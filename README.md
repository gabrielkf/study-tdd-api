# TDD API
Small project to explore TDD and .NET 6

The tests were made with xUnit, FluentAssertions and Moq.

## What was explored
- Mocking dependencies:
    - Service
    - Http Client
    - Configuration (appsettings.json)
- Controller test (mocking the service)
- Service test (mocking http client and configuration)
